# Advanced Scientific Calculator

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-blue)  
A sleek, modern, and feature-rich scientific calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Experience a visually stunning interface with animated effects, scientific functions, memory operations, and responsive design, perfect for both basic and advanced calculations.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Dual Modes**: Switch between **Basic** and **Scientific** modes for simple arithmetic or advanced mathematical operations.
- **Scientific Functions**: Includes trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, and inverses), logarithms (`log`, `ln`), square roots, factorials, and more.
- **Memory Operations**: Store, recall, add, subtract, and clear memory with dedicated buttons (`MS`, `MR`, `M+`, `M-`, `MC`).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations, glowing effects, and a dynamic particle system for an engaging user experience.
- **Keyboard Support**: Perform calculations using your keyboard for faster input.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages with shake animation for invalid inputs.
- **Customizable Angle Mode**: Toggle between degrees and radians for trigonometric calculations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- No additional dependencies required!

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-scientific-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd advanced-scientific-calculator
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click `index.html`, or
   - Use a local server (e.g., `npx http-server` or VS Code's Live Server extension).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Mode
- Perform standard arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`).
- Use `AC` to reset, `CE` to clear the current entry, and `⌫` for backspace.
- Toggle the sign with `±`.

### Scientific Mode
- Access advanced functions like `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `ln`, `√`, `x^y`, `x!`, and constants (`π`, `e`).
- Switch between degrees and radians (via code modification; see `angleMode` in script).

### Memory Functions
- Store values with `MS`, recall with `MR`, add/subtract with `M+`/`M-`, and clear with `MC`.
- A green `M` indicator shows active memory.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Numbers (`0-9`), operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), decimal (`.`), `Enter`/`=` for calculation.
- `Escape` for `AC`, `Backspace` for delete, `c`/`C` for `CE`.
